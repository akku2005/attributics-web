## The Platform Illusion

D2C brands today have many tools — Customer Engagement Platforms like MoEngage, Braze, CleverTap, CDPs like Salesforce Data Cloud and Tealium, and analytics solutions like Adobe Analytics, Amplitude, and GA4. But having all these tools doesn't automatically result in better insights. Everything hinges on **clean event schema design**.

## When Everyone Owns It, No One Owns It

Event schemas define what user actions are tracked, when they fire, and how the data is structured. In reality, every team tracks what matters only to them:

- Marketing tracks campaigns  
- CRM tracks WhatsApp and email triggers  
- Data teams want granular events  
- Tech teams sometimes propose generic events  

The result: a bloated schema with redundant or conflicting events. No visibility into what’s live or needed.

## The Real Cost of a Messy Schema

Poorly structured data causes:

- Reports that are ignored  
- Failed segmentation  
- Surface-level personalization  
- Decisions based on unreliable data  

Tools aren't the problem — **bad setup and planning** is.

## Start with Less. Build What You’ll Use

Tracking too many events often leads to tracking nothing well. Focus on the most important journeys:

1. User signup journey  
2. Onboarding for first purchase  
3. Cart abandoner journey  
4. Product engagement and browser abandonment  
5. Post-purchase feedback  
6. Loyalty points redemption  
7. In-store purchasers to online engagement  
8. Dormant users — win back journey  
9. Wishlist recovery to purchase journey  
10. Cancelled/returned orders to repurchase  

These core journeys cover 80–90% of use cases if tracked properly.

## How to Design a Schema That Works

1. Align all stakeholders — marketing, CRM, product, tech, analytics.  
2. Define key KPIs and critical touchpoints.  
3. Build a lean, reusable schema with consistent event names.  
4. Document centrally and maintain it like product infrastructure.  
5. Run periodic sanity checks to remove outdated events.

## A Clean, Scalable Event Structure

Keep schemas:

- Concise and easy to manage  
- Flexible for growth  
- Standardized across platforms  

Every event should serve a reporting, segmentation, or campaign function.

## Maturing Over Time

After the foundation is in place:

- Enrich journeys with user attributes  
- Add dynamic campaign triggers  
- Introduce channel orchestration  
- Build predictive segments for churn, upsell, or retention  

Only after the basics work well.

## The Bottom Line

Most D2C brands don’t lack data — they lack **disciplined, consistent tracking**. Good platforms can't fix bad schemas. Track what matters, maintain it, and focus on **the right data**, not the most data.
